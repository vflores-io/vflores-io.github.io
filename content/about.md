Hi! I love learning about new stuff and diving into the world of data science and machine learning. I have been exploring Bayesian modeling, Gaussian processes, and deep learning. I'm comfortable working with Julia and Python, and in a past life, MATLAB too. I enjoy creating tutorials and sharing what I learn with others. When I'm not learning about Bayesian stuff, you'll find me swimming, running, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, probably while listening to some flavor of metal ðŸ¤˜.

I'm always looking for hands-on collaborations on data science and machine learning projects. Reach out to discuss what we can build together!
